Týr (/t??r/;[1] Old Norse: Týr [ty?r]) is a Germanic god associated with law and heroic glory in Norse mythology, portrayed as one-handed. Corresponding names in other Germanic languages are Gothic Teiws, Old English Tiw and Old High German Ziu and Cyo, all from Proto-Germanic *Tiwaz. The Latinised name is rendered as Tius or Tio and also formally as Mars Thincsus.[2]

In the late Icelandic Eddas, Týr is portrayed, alternately, as the son of Odin (Prose Edda) or of Hymir (Poetic Edda), while the origins of his name and his possible relationship to Tuisto (see Tacitus' Germania) suggest he was once considered the father of the gods and head of the pantheon, since his name is ultimately cognate to that of *Dyeus (cf. Dyaus), the reconstructed chief deity in Indo-European religion. It is assumed that Tîwaz was overtaken in popularity and in authority by both Odin and Thor at some point during the Migration Age, as Odin shares his role as God of war.

Tiw was equated with Mars in the interpretatio germanica. Tuesday is "Tiw's Day" (also in Alemannic Zischtig from zîes tag), translating dies Martis.
